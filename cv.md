## ABOUT ME

I am from Ukraine. Due to the war, I had to move to a new country and start my career path from the very beginning. In work, mobility and the opportunity to realize my potential are important for me. Programmer friends recommended that I consider IT, as they think I have the right mindset for a developer. I decided to give it a try and started learning HTML and CSS as a hobby. It really fascinated me and I decided to learn a new profession - Frontend Developer.
